'''
The primary objective of the PandA project is to develop a usable framework that will
enable the research of new ideas in the HW-SW Co-Design field.

The PandA framework includes methodologies supporting the research on high-level synthesis
of hardware accelerators, on parallelism extraction for embedded systems, on hardware/software
partitioning and mapping, on metrics for performance estimation of embedded software
applications and on dynamic reconfigurable devices.
