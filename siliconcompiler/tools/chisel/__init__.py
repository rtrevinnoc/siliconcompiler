Chisel is a hardware design language that facilitates advanced circuit
generation and design reuse for both ASIC and FPGA digital logic designs.
Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the Scala programming
language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming
language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce
synthesizable Verilog.
