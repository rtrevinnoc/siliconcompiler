sv2v converts SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800-2017) to Verilog
(IEEE 1364-2005), with an emphasis on supporting synthesizable
language constructs. The primary goal of this project is to
create a completely free and open-source tool for converting
SystemVerilog to Verilog. While methods for performing this
conversion already exist, they generally either rely on
commercial tools, or are limited in scope.
