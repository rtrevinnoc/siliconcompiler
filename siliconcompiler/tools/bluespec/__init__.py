Bluespec is a high-level hardware description language. It has a variety of
advanced features including a powerful type system that can prevent errors
prior to synthesis time, and its most distinguishing feature, Guarded Atomic
Actions, allow you to define hardware components in a modular manner based
on their invariants, and let the compiler pick a scheduler.
