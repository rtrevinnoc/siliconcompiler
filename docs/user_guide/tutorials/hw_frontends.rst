Hardware Design Frontends
===================================

In addition to traditional hardware description languages like Verilog and SystemVerilog, SiliconCompiler also supports higher-level languages, for ease of hardware design prototyping.

Here are some tutorials of a few different types of high-level hardware design frontends:

* :ref:`Python-based frontends (Migen) <python_frontends>`

* :ref:`chisel frontend <chisel_frontend>`

* :ref:`C HLS frontend (Bambu) <c_hls_frontend>`

* :ref:`bluespec frontend <bluespec_frontend>`
